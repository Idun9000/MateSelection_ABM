## Title of paper
Modeling Heterosexual Mate Selection: Exploring the Impact of Gender Distribution on Online Dating Platforms - an agent-based modeling study 

## Hypotheses investigated
H1: The ABM will demonstrate that a skewed gender distribution will lead to gender biases in matching success.

H1.1: Specifically, the underrepresented gender will have a higher match percentage, as they will have more options and be in higher demand. 

H1.2: Conversely, there will be pronounced inequality in match acquisition indicated by a higher Gini coefficient than for the equal gender distribution. 

## Parameter settings (used for results section)
Steps: 1000

Evaluation interval: 20

Number of women: 200 when gender ratio is 1 and 100 when gender ratio is 3 (400 agents in total)

Perception factor: ranging from 0.01-0.2 (increasing by 0.05)
